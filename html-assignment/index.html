        <p>My hometown is Xi'an, Shaanxi, China, a city with a history of over two thousand years. You may not have heard of its name, but you have probably heard of the Terracotta Army of Emperor Qin Shi Huang located there. I earned a Bachelor's degree in <strong>Electronic Engineering</strong> from <abbr title="Northwestern Polytechnical University">NWPU</abbr> in China in the early 21<sup>st</sup> century and have worked for 25 years since then. My career experience is quite diverse. I have been an <em>electronic engineer, manufacturing engineer, sales director, general manager of a software company, and a professional outdoor adventure guide</em>. I have also had <strong>two entrepreneurial experiences</strong>.</p>

        <p>At the age of 45, I decided to leave China, where I spent the first half of my life, and move to Canada to explore a completely new field of study, which is <abbr title="Interactive Media Disign">IMD</abbr>. My goal is to live the life I want to experience. My life journey has led me to uphold one belief: </p>
